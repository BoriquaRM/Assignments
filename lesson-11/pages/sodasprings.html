					<p>"Bravado"<br>by David Olsen</p><hr>
					<p>The arena was set, the lights dimmed, and both champions sat… but only one was truly ready for what came next.</p>
					<p>The surrounding crowd fell silent. No murmur was heard, not even the whistling wind dared break the focus.</p>
					<p>A fist clenched around the instrument of choice, one which had claimed many already. Perhaps today, another.</p>
					<p>The other sat, defenseless, yet feigning ignorance at the danger presented.</p>
					<p>The fist lifted, pointing a finger. The finger moved rapidly, then returned as a fist again.</p>
					<p>The battle… had begun.</p>
					<p><i>*ring, ring*</i></p>
					<p>“Hello?”</p>
					<p>“Yes, yes, hello?”</p>
					<p>“Can I help you?”</p>
					<p>“Ah, yes sir, hello, I am with Computer Customer Care, how are you doing today?”</p>
					<p>“Fine, I guess. What’s this about?”</p>
					<p>“Oh sir, our records indicate that your computer has been infected with computer viruses. This is most unfortunate, as it can slow down your system, delete files and be a very real problem. I’m calling to help you delete these awful viruses.”</p>
					<p>Hmph, sure you are.</p>
					<p>There are moments of my life when I am compelled to admit stupidity, most of them being in my teen years, yet I am no stranger to bullies, punks or even the whipper-snapping hooligan. In this case, it took the form of a Middle-Eastern scammer who has now called for the third time to tell me about viruses that I don’t have. </p>
					<p>It’s especially bad when he has to ask for my name. He’s monitoring my computer, but doesn’t know who I am. Right.</p>
					<p>Like the other two times before, I was content on hanging up without further argument, but I paused, caught in a mental tug-of-war. I’d spent the greater portion of my young life being picked on, pushed around, taken advantage of. Like a wounded puppy that was kicked one time too many, I made a decision. </p>
					<p>This time… I would have some fun.</p>
					<p>“Oh, sorry, I just dropped something, didn’t catch all of that. Did you say something about getting rid of viruses?”</p>
					<p>“Oh yes, sir, we are aware that you’re infected with many, many of them, and it should be taken care of right away.”</p>
					<p>“Oh, finally! I’ve been trying to get someone to look at them for a while now. See, I just got back from an overseas trip, and I’ve had problems ever since.”</p>
					<p>“Well then, sir, I’m happy to help, can you…”</p>
					<p>“So it started off as a rash. Just red and blotchy, you know? Really itchy.”</p>
					<p>“I can… wait, what?”</p>
					<p>“But then it got worse the more I scratched it, which yeah, they tell you not to do, but that topical cream wasn’t working, and it started going up my…”</p>
					<p>“Sir? Sir! I am sorry, no, but I cannot help you with those kinds of viruses.”</p>
					<p>“Oh, this isn’t the dermatologist?”</p>
					<p>“No sir, this is Computer Service Care, for the removal of computer viruses.”</p>
					<p>“Oh. Oh! Wow, yeah, I guess you didn’t need to know any of that, huh?”</p>
					<p>“No sir, completely unnecessary.”</p>
					<p>“Alright, well, what do you need me to do?”</p>
					<p>“I need you to go to your desktop computer.”</p>
					<p>“Oh, yeah, of course, but it’s in my bedroom.”</p>
					<p>“Excellent, go ahead and go to it.”</p>
					<p>“It’s kind of old though, still has Windows 95. Is that a problem?”</p>
					<p>“No, not a problem, sir, go ahead and power it on.”</p>
					<p>“Oh, umm, I don’t actually have a power cord for it, it’s just been sitting in my closet for a few years. But you know what, I can go run to Best Buy real quick and get a cord. Do you mind waiting on the phone for about 30 minutes while I get it?”</p>
					<p>“No, sir, no, this is not needed… do you have a laptop instead?”</p>
					<p>“Oh yeah, of course!”</p>
					<p>“Okay, that will work just fine, please go find your laptop.”</p>
					<p>“Sure thing.” (whistling) “Pepper!”</p>
					<p>“… uh, sir? What are you…?”</p>
					<p>“Pep… oh there you are, Peps, how you doin’ buddy? Who’s a gooood booooy?”</p>
					<p>“Sir, what… what is going on?”</p>
					<p>“You asked for my lapdog. This little guy is a Pomeranian, and he’s sooo cuuuute, yes you aaare. Kisses!”</p>
					<p>“Okay, sir? Sir! Please, I just need you to turn on your laptop.”</p>
					<p>“… kinda sounds like a job for a girl dog, don’t you think?”</p>
					<p><i>*click*</i></p>
					<p>Every day is a good day for a little bravado.</p>
